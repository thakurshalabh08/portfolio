    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

The sum of matrices is determined by the sum in F-algebra, and the product of matrices is determined by the product of mappings.

As an example, I consider the solution of a system of linear equations over the complex field provided that the equations contain unknown quantities and their conjugates.\\n  Linear mappings of algebra over a commutative ring preserve the operation of addition in algebra and the product of elements of the algebra by elements of the ring.

In traditional RAG approaches, a basic framework is employed to retrieve documents that enrich the context of an LLM prompt. 5. **Retrieve relevant data:** Search the vector database for embeddings that closely match the query’s embedding based on semantic similarity. * Pathway AI Pipelines: A production-ready RAG framework supporting real-time indexing, retrieval, and change tracking across diverse data sources.

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. This process flow helps developers update data sources without retraining the model and makes RAG a scalable and cost-effective solution for building LLM applications in domains like customer support, knowledge bases and internal search. This is called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), as you would retrieve the relevant data and use it as augmented context for the LLM. With RAG architecture, organizations can deploy any LLM model and augment it to return relevant results for their organization by giving it a small amount of their data without the costs and time of fine-tuning or pretraining the model.', 'url': 'https://www.databricks.com/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag'}\n",

      "✅ Final answer:\n",
      "It seems there was an issue with retrieving information from external sources. I will provide an overview of radio observations of recurrent novae based on my existing knowledge, and you can let me know if there are specific aspects you'd like to explore further.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview of Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent novae are a subtype of cataclysmic variable stars that undergo multiple outbursts, typically over decades. These systems are composed of a white dwarf and a companion star, often a red giant or main-sequence star, from which the white dwarf accretes material. When the accreted material reaches a critical pressure and temperature, it ignites in a thermonuclear runaway, causing the nova outburst.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Role of Radio Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Detecting Ejecta\n",
      "Radio observations are crucial in studying the ejecta from nova explosions. When a nova erupts, it expels material at high velocities. The interaction of this material with the surrounding interstellar medium or with previously ejected material produces shock waves that can emit radio waves. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Understanding Emission Mechanisms\n",
      "Radio emissions help scientists understand different emission mechanisms at play, such as synchrotron emissions, which can indicate the presence of magnetic fields and relativistic particles. Thermal emissions from ionized gases can also be observed, providing insights into the physical conditions of the ejected material.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Estimating Mass Ejection\n",
      "By measuring radio flux and deciphering its spectrum, researchers can estimate the mass and energy of the ejected material. This is crucial for understanding the accretion and outburst processes in recurrent novae systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Probing Binary Interactions\n",
      "Radio studies can also provide information about the binary interaction dynamics, especially in systems where the nova eruption might affect the accretion processes from the companion star.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recent Research and Case Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "While there's a broad body of literature on this topic, some notable novae such as RS Ophiuchi have been extensively studied in radio wavelengths. Observations of such objects have significantly advanced our understanding of shock interactions and particle acceleration in stellar environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need specific studies or recent findings, do let me know, and I can try to retrieve more detailed information given another opportunity.\n",

    "- **Details**: Your reflection should cover strengths, limitations, suggestions, and opportunities. The revised report should incorporate these elements to improve clarity and academic tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Overview of Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recurrent Novae**: Recurrent novae are binary star systems where a white dwarf and a companion star orbit each other. They experience periodic outbursts due to the accumulation and subsequent runaway thermonuclear reaction of accreted material from the companion star onto the white dwarf's surface. Unlike classical novae, which may have only a single outburst, recurrent novae undergo multiple outbursts with intervals ranging from a year to several decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Radio Observations**: \n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae provide critical insights into the physical processes occurring during and after the outburst. These observations can detect non-thermal emissions from shock interactions (either between the nova ejecta and the surrounding medium or internally within the ejecta). Key areas of focus include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Ejecta Velocity and Mass**: Radio observations help measure the velocity of the ejected material, which in turn allows researchers to estimate the mass of the material involved during the outburst.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Thermal and Non-Thermal Emissions**: Novae typically emit thermal radio waves from free-free emission as the hot gases expand and cool. Additionally, non-thermal radio emissions might be detected, often attributed to synchrotron radiation from accelerated particles in shock regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Morphological Studies**: Radio imaging can reveal the structure of the nova ejecta. For some novae, observations have unveiled elongated or asymmetric morphologies, suggesting interactions with the companion star's wind or the presence of jets.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Comparison with Other Wavelengths**: Radio data are often combined with optical, UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations to build a multi-wavelength view of the nova, providing a comprehensive understanding of the energy processes and material distribution during the nova event.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Concluding Remarks\n",
      "\n",
      "While detailed findings from recent studies were not accessible due to tool limitations, the outlined aspects highlight why radio observations are invaluable to studying recurrent novae. These observations contribute significantly to comprehending the physics underpinning such stellar phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a more in-depth and updated exploration, consulting current studies in databases such as arXiv or using specific astrophysical journals is recommended.\n",
      "=== Research Report (preliminary) ===\n",
      "\n",

      "### Overview of Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recurrent Novae**: Recurrent novae are binary star systems where a white dwarf and a companion star orbit each other. They experience periodic outbursts due to the accumulation and subsequent runaway thermonuclear reaction of accreted material from the companion star onto the white dwarf's surface. Unlike classical novae, which may have only a single outburst, recurrent novae undergo multiple outbursts with intervals ranging from a year to several decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Radio Observations**: \n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae provide critical insights into the physical processes occurring during and after the outburst. These observations can detect non-thermal emissions from shock interactions (either between the nova ejecta and the surrounding medium or internally within the ejecta). Key areas of focus include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Ejecta Velocity and Mass**: Radio observations help measure the velocity of the ejected material, which in turn allows researchers to estimate the mass of the material involved during the outburst.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Thermal and Non-Thermal Emissions**: Novae typically emit thermal radio waves from free-free emission as the hot gases expand and cool. Additionally, non-thermal radio emissions might be detected, often attributed to synchrotron radiation from accelerated particles in shock regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Morphological Studies**: Radio imaging can reveal the structure of the nova ejecta. For some novae, observations have unveiled elongated or asymmetric morphologies, suggesting interactions with the companion star's wind or the presence of jets.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Comparison with Other Wavelengths**: Radio data are often combined with optical, UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations to build a multi-wavelength view of the nova, providing a comprehensive understanding of the energy processes and material distribution during the nova event.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Concluding Remarks\n",
      "\n",
      "While detailed findings from recent studies were not accessible due to tool limitations, the outlined aspects highlight why radio observations are invaluable to studying recurrent novae. These observations contribute significantly to comprehending the physics underpinning such stellar phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a more in-depth and updated exploration, consulting current studies in databases such as arXiv or using specific astrophysical journals is recommended.\n",

      "The user report provides a comprehensive evaluation of strengths and limitations, but it lacks clarity in certain sections, making it difficult for readers to grasp the key points. The strengths are well-articulated, highlighting the effectiveness of the program, but the limitations section could benefit from more specific examples and a clearer structure. Additionally, the report could enhance its academic tone by avoiding colloquial language and ensuring that all claims are supported by evidence. Suggestions for improvement include reorganizing the limitations section to follow a clear format, incorporating specific case studies or data to illustrate points, and refining the language to maintain a formal tone. Opportunities for further development include expanding on the implications of the findings and suggesting actionable recommendations based on the evaluation. \n",

      "This report evaluates the strengths and limitations of the program in a structured manner. The strengths identified include the program's effectiveness in achieving its objectives, as evidenced by participant feedback and performance metrics. However, several limitations have been noted. Firstly, the sample size for the evaluation was relatively small, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Secondly, there were inconsistencies in the data collection methods, leading to potential biases in the results. To address these limitations, it is recommended that future evaluations utilize a larger and more diverse sample size and standardize data collection procedures. Furthermore, the report suggests that ongoing monitoring and evaluation be implemented to continuously assess the program's impact. Overall, while the program demonstrates significant strengths, addressing the identified limitations will enhance its effectiveness and sustainability. \n",
